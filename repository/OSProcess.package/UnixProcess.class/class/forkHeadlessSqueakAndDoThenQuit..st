forkHeadlessSqueakAndDoThenQuit: aBlock 
	"Start a new instance of Squeak running in a child OS process, and 
	execute aBlock in the child instance. The new instance is a clone of
	this image, but without a connection to the X display. The child instance
	executes aBlock, which hopefully does not involve interaction with the
	X display; and the parent continues normally.

	The child should not depend on using existing connections to external 
	resources. For example, the child may lose its connections to stdin, stdout,
	and stderr after its parent exits."
