I represent a Macintosh operating system process, such as the process in which the Squeak VM is currently running. I collaborate with an instance of MacOSProcessAccessor to provide primitive access to the external operating system. My instance variables are maintained as a convenience to allow inspection of an OSProcess. Access to these variables should always be done with my accessor methods, which update the instance variables by querying my MacOSProcessAccessor.
