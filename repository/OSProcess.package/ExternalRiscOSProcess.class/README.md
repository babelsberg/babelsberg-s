I represent an external RiscOS task other than the process in which this Squeak is executing. I maintain information about the state of the external task during and after the lifetime of the task. In particular, I hold the exit status of the task after it completes execution. When the external task changes state (e.g. it exits), the VM signals a Squeak semaphore. A singleton RiscOSProcessAccessor maintains a process which waits on the semaphore, and sends a changed: #childProcessStatus message to itself, thereby notifying its dependent RiscOSProcess (a singleton) to check the status of all its ExternalRiscOSProcess children, and #update: them accordingly.
