I represent an external Unix process other than the process in which this Squeak is executing. I maintain information about the state of the external process during and after the lifetime of the process. In particular, I hold the exit status of the process after it completes execution. When the external process changes state (e.g. it exits), the VM signals a Squeak semaphore. A singleton UnixProcessAccessor maintains a process which waits on the semaphore, and sends a changed: #childProcessStatus message to itself, thereby notifying its dependent UnixProcess (a singleton) to check the status of all its ExternalUnixProcess children, and #update: them accordingly.
