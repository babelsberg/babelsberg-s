Test file locking with the UnixOSProcessPlugin. The test suite requires that OSProcess and CommandShell be loaded in the image.

These tests rely on a remote Squeak image to test file locks between cooperating Unix processes. This may be timing dependent (see #delay, set in #setUp, and cleanup in #tearDown). In case of intermittent failures, try running the failed test individually. In some cases it may be necessary to restart Squeak in order to clear leftover file locks from previous failed tests.
