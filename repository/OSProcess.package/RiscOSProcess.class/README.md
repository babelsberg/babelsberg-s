I represent an Acorn RiscOS operating system task, such as the task in which the Squeak VM is currently running. I collaborate with a singleton instance of RiscOSProcessAccessor to provide primitive access to the external operating system. My instance variables are maintained as a convenience to allow inspection of a RiscOSProcess. Access to these variables should always be done with my accessor methods, which update the instance variables by querying my RiscOSProcessAccessor.
