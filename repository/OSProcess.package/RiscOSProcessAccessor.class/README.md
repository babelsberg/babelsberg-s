I provide access to the operating system process in which the Squeak VM is currently running. I am based on the RiscOS task model. There is only one instance of me, and instances of RiscOSProcess depend on me to provide access to the operating system process which they represent. I know how to create child processes. I use a semaphore to receive signals when child processes die, and I notify my dependents (instances ofRiscOSProcess) when these events occur.
