PseudoAioEventHandler is a replacement for AioEventHandler for use when an AioPlugin is not present. It creates a polling loop by generating #changed: events periodically. With a real AioEventHandler, events are generated only when actual IO activity occurs, while the PseudoAioEventHandler produces regularly timed events regardless of whether any actual IO changes have happened.
