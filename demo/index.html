    <p>This is a very early version of SqueakJS running a Babelsberg/S image.<br><br>
    <a href="https://bertfreudenberg.github.io/SqueakJS">SqueakJS</a> is a <a href="http://squeak.org/" target="_blank">Squeak</a> VM written in pure JavaScript by Bert Freudenberg.
    It is here used to run a Babelsberg/S image directly in your browser. You will need a fast computer. According to our benchmarks the performance is best with Safari 8, followed by Internet Explorer 11, Firefox 35, and Chrome 38.
