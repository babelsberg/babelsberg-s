Babelsberg/S
=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/babelsberg/babelsberg-s.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/babelsberg/babelsberg-s)

A Squeak/Smalltalk implementation of Babelsberg licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/babelsberg/babelsberg-s/blob/master/LICENSE)

See also [Babelsberg/R](https://github.com/babelsberg/babelsberg-r) and [Babelsberg/JS](https://github.com/babelsberg/babelsberg-js)

Work in progress.

## How to Install

#### Download prebuilt image

Prebuilt images are published when the tests are green. You probably
want the
[Image](http://www.lively-kernel.org/babelsberg/BabelsbergS/BabelsbergS.image),
[Changes](http://www.lively-kernel.org/babelsberg/BabelsbergS/BabelsbergS.changes),
and [Sources](http://www.lively-kernel.org/babelsberg/BabelsbergS/SqueakV41.sources). You can also [try it online](https://bertfreudenberg.github.io/SqueakJS/run#url=http://www.lively-kernel.org/babelsberg/BabelsbergS/&files=[BabelsbergS.image,BabelsbergS.changes,SqueakV41.sources]) through [SqueakJS](http://github.com/bertfreudenberg/SqueakJS) (but note that this runs very slowly, and does not support Z3).

#### Install into your own image

1. Get [Squeak 4.5 or later](http://www.squeak.org) with a recent [CogVM](http://www.mirandabanda.org/files/Cog/VM/) for your operating system. Make sure that the SqueakSSL plugin is included (should be true for all official distributions.)
2. Load Babelsberg/S into your image (You need Metacello[ยน](#Metacello))

```Smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'BabelsbergS';
  repository: 'github://babelsberg/babelsberg-s/repository';
  load.
```

## How to develop

If you want to forward development, there are a number of areas that
need work. In general, the system needs to be refactored so other
constraint solvers (e.g. DeltaBlue) can be added more easily. There
are also a number of things that this implementation does not do, yet,
that are desirable, such as identity constraints, constraint
priorities at time of definition, proper readonly variables, or
automatic recalculation of constraints when a complex object involved
in the constraint changes identity (the latter is an optimization
found in the Babelsberg/R and Babelsberg/JS implementations). Further
down the road, the constraints from different constraint solvers
should be able to interact (as implemented in Babelsberg/JS).

The repository includes a package, Babelsberg-Tests, that includes the
conformance tests generated from the
[executable semantics](https://github.com/babelsberg/babelsberg-rml). These
may be a little outdated if they have not been regenerated in some
time, but in any case, a goal for further development should be to
improve pass rates on these tests. As a guideline, Babelsberg/JS
currently passes 39 of these tests using a combination of Z3 and
DeltaBlue (the latter for identity constraints). Getting the number
for Babelsberg/S up to mid-30 would be worthwhile.

## Metacello

In case you do not have Metacello in your Squeak image, bootstrap it like this:

```Smalltalk
Installer gemsource
    project: 'metacello';
    install: 'ConfigurationOfMetacello'.

"Bootstrap Metacello Preview"
((Smalltalk at: #ConfigurationOfMetacello) project version: #'previewBootstrap') load.

"Load the Preview version of Metacello from GitHub and then load Latest Baseline"
(Smalltalk at: #Metacello) new
  configuration: 'MetacelloPreview';
  version: #stable;
  repository: 'github://Metacello/metacello:configuration';
  load.
(Smalltalk at: #Metacello) new
  baseline: 'Metacello';
  repository: 'github://Metacello/metacello:master/repository';
  get.
(Smalltalk at: #Metacello) new
  baseline: 'Metacello';
  repository: 'github://Metacello/metacello:master/repository';
  load.
```
